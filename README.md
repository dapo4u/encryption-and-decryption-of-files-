I made two different apps for the protection of files
# APPLICATION 1 IS CALLED "PWD" 
HOW TO CREATE A PASSWORD PROTECTED PDF DOCUMENTS

You password protected any PDF document with my app,this is to prevent unauthorized access to the 
PDF file such as your Monthly Bank account statement, 
this is why Banks do send password protected documents to their customers .



# STEP 1: CREATE A FOLDER ON YOUR COMPUTER WITH THE NAME -PWD OR WHATEVER NAME YOU WANT.TO DO THIS, OPEN YOUR CMD COMMAND LINE.

# TYPE mkdir pwd

# STEP 2:OPEN THE ABOVE FOLDER WITH A VSCODE EDITOR. CREATE A FILE WITH A NAME  app.py USING A VSCODE TEXT EDITOR. 
# THERE IS A FILE ATTACHED TO  THIS REPOSITORY ABOVE CALLED "app.py".

# OPEN THE FILE ,COPY THE CODE AND PASTE THE CODE IN THE PYTHON FILE WITH THE NAME app.py 

# THAT YOU CREATED USING THE VSCODE.SAVE THE FILE.

# STEP 3.you must install python CORRECTLY on your PC.

# STEP 4.you must install pypdf2.

# install pypdf2 with the command -pip install PyPDF2

# TO RUN THE CODE.

# 1.Open your CMD Terminal .

# 2.type cd pwd

# 3.type python app.py

# 4.you shall see a pop up

# 5.type and save the new name of the pdf file you want to encrypt

# 6.Set and save the password for the new pdf file.

# For full explanation ,please watch the video above 



# APPLICATION 2:  ENCRYPT AND DECRYPT A FILE

I WANT TO SHOW YOU HOW TO MAKE AN APP THAT CAN ENCRYPT AND DECRYPT ANY FILE-WHETHER ITS A VIDEO,MUSIC,PHOTO,OR PDF FILE.

# STEP TO MAKE THE ENCRYPT APP

I CALLED THIS APP "ENCRYPT".

# STEP1 : YOU MUST INSTALL PYTHON CORRECTLY ON YOUR PC

# STEP2: YOU MUST INSTALL ALL OTHER DEPENDENCIES AND MODULES ,WITHOUT EXCEPTION FOR THIS 
APP TO WORK(OTHER WISE THE APP WILL NOT WORK).
THE MODULES ARE CRYPTOGRAPHY ,TKINTER ,AND OTHER DEPENDENCIES THAT ARE NEEDED

# STEP3: CREATE A FOLDER ON YOUR PC USING YOUR CMD COMMAND LINE.

# OPEN YOUR CMD. TYPE, mkdir encrypt

# STEP4 :OPEN THEABOVE  CREATED FOLDER WHICH IS encrypt  WITH A VSCODE TEXT EDITOR ,CREATE A PYTHON FILE WITH THE "main.py" 
# THERE IS A FILE ATTACHED TO  THIS REPOSITORY ABOVE CALLED "main.py".

# OPEN THE FILE ,COPY THE CODE AND PASTE THE CODE IN THE PYTHON FILE WITH THE NAME main.py 

# THAT YOU CREATED USING THE VSCODE.

# SAVE THE FILE WITH CONTROL PLUS S COMMAND ON THE VSCODE EDITOR.

# STEP 5 OPEN YOUR CMD COMMAND LINE ON YOUR PC.

# STEP6.TYPE cd encrypt .(remember encrypt is the name of the folder that contains the python file-main.py

# STEP 7.TYPE python main.py
